  Automate is targeted at electronics.
  Bringing brains as a central brain to configure your electronics setup.
  You own it.  Not someone else.  Open source.

  <div class="description_big">Common Communication</div>

<p>
The idea is to create a common interface with a single consistent easy to use communication.
  Loosely coupled communication.  Over MQTT, but with common interfaces for http.

<div class="description_big">Powerful Tools</div>
<p>
  Logic engine, scheduler, sequencers, and other tools create easy to reprogram system.
</p>

<div class="description_big">No configuration files</div>
<p>
  Configuration files are awful.  Instead we use common conventions with an easy to use user-interface.
  Able to extent functionality via javascript, not messy configuration.
</p>

<div class="description_big">Not an advertising platform</div>
<p>
  You own it. Runs on your own gear.  This is not a promotion tool to promote products.
  No spying on you.  This is yours.  Say bye bye big brother.
